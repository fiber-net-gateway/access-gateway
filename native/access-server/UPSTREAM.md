# Upstream provenance

The initial `native/access-server` source was imported from
`fiber-net-gateway/fiber-gateway-cpp/apps/access-server` at revision
`0fda7764bf94944aca4b674ab5ab311184703118`.

The application is maintained in this repository after the import. The reusable Fiber runtime,
HTTP, JSON/script, Nacos, CAT, and Prometheus modules are consumed from the pinned
`third_party/fiber-gateway-cpp` submodule. Updating that submodule gitlink is independent of this
historical application import revision.

The import preserves upstream source, tests, fixtures, documentation, scripts, and the example
environment file. Repository-integration changes replace upstream-relative test-support includes,
wire the application into `native/CMakeLists.txt`, and update build paths in the copied docs.

The Java compatibility baseline remains `ploto-gateway` revision
`22c2bf543b96b52c0ccecd4ceb07d4911c502f45`. Preserve `LICENSE.upstream` and update this file when
intentionally synchronizing application code from upstream.
